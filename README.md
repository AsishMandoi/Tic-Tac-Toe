# Tic-Tac-Toe: A React App

[Here](https://asishmandoi.github.io/tic-tac-toe-app/) is the link to the publicly deployed version. Go on... play with it, tell me how it is.

This is a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Indicates when the result being is a draw,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
