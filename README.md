This is a tic-tac-toe game that:

- Lets you play tic-tac-toe,
- Indicates when a player has won the game,
- Indicates when the result being is a draw,
- Stores a game’s history as a game progresses,
- Allows players to review a game’s history and see previous versions of a game’s board.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
